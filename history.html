		<h1>Hybrid Technology</h1>
        <h3>
			The first hybrid car was built in the year 1899 by engineer Ferdinand Porsche. Called the System
			<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/20246/the-real-story-behind-the-worlds-first-hybrid-car">Lohner-Porsche Mixte</a>, it used a petrol engine to supply power to an electric motor that drove the
			car's front wheels. The Mixte was well-received, and over 300 were produced. The demand for
			hybrids began to wane, however, when Henry Ford started the first automobile assembly line in
			1904. Ford's ability to produce petrol-powered cars and offer them at low prices dramatically shrunk
			the hy brid vehicle market. While hybrids were produced well into the 1910s using the Mixte's
			technology, most sold poorly because they had higher prices and less power than their petrolpowered counterparts. Hybrids soon became a thing of the past, beginning a nearly 50-year period
			where they were merely an afterthought.

		1973 saw the introduction of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Arab-oil-embargo">Arab oil embargo</a>, and with it the price of fuel rocketed.
		Volkswagen’s ‘Taxi’, a hybrid which allowed switching between the petrol engine and electric motor,
		logged over 8,000 miles on the road and was shown at car shows throughout the world.
		In 1989 Audi took the wraps off the first generation of the <a href="https://www.topgear.com.ph/features/feature-articles/1989-audi-duo-tguk-a2613-20200516">Audi Duo experimental plug-in hybrid
		vehicle <a/>, based on the 100 Avant. The rear wheels were powered by a 12bhp Siemens electric motor
		instead of a propeller shaft, with a nickel-cadmium battery supplying the energy. The front wheels
		were powered by a 134bhp 2.3-litre five-cylinder petrol unit. Just ten examples were made, with the
		cars running less efficiently when running on their engines alone than the standard Audi 100s.
		The seed of a mass-produced hybrid car had been well and truly sewn, however, and in 1992 the
		Volvo ECC (Environmental Concept Car) was built, based on the Volvo 850 platform. It used a hybrid
		electric and gas turbine engine to drive the generator for recharging, instead of using the more
		popular piston engine to provide additional acceleration and to recharge the battery storage.
		It was followed in 1997 by the revolutionary Toyota Prius, which was first introduced to the Japanese
		market. Approximately 18,000 examples were sold worldwide in the first year.
		In 1997 Audi fought back, becoming the first European manufacturer to take a hybrid car into
		volume production with the <a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-1997-audi-a4-avant-duo-was-a-hybrid-diesel-wagon-we-1840708240"> Duo III</a> - based on the B5 Audi A4 Avant. A 90bhp 1.9-litre TDI diesel
		engine mated to a 28bhp electric motor drove the front wheels. However, low demand and a high
		price tag meant that only 60 examples were made.
		1999 saw the two-door <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Insight">Honda Insight</a> launched in the United States and Japan. The first hybrid car
		to hit the mass market in the United States, the Insight was capable of a combined cycle of 78mpg
		and won numerous awards for its innovation.
		The turn of the millennium saw the Toyota Prius being released in Europe, North America and the
		rest of the world. Combined fuel consumption was estimated at 58mpg.

	<h2> History of Hybrid Technology </h2>
<ul>
	 
		<h3>2002</h3>
		<li>
		
		In 2002 Honda introduced the Civic Hybrid. Based on the seventh generation Civic, the Hybrid
appeared identical in appearance and drivability to the conventional Civic, delivering up to 60mpg.
Toyota quickly followed with the launch of the second-generation Prius in 2004 
		</li>
		
	
		<h3>2007</h3> 
		<li>Lexus joined the hybrid revolution in 2007 with the release of a hybrid electric version of its GS
saloon model, the GS 450h. The car had a power output of 335bhp.
  </li>
	
	
		<h3>2009</h3>
		<li>2009 saw Hyundai unveil the Elantra LPI Hybrid at the Seoul Motor Show. The Elantra LPI was the
world’s first hybrid vehicle to be powered by an internal combustion engine running on LPG. It was
also the first hybrid to adopt advanced lithium-ion polymer batteries. The Elantra LPI delivered Co2
emissions of 99g/km to qualify as a ‘Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle.’
The same year also saw Mercedes pull the wraps off the S400 Blue Hybrid. The hybrid technology in
the S400 was co-developed by Daimler AG and BMW.

		<h3>2010</h3></li>		
	<li>
		In 2010 three manufacturers bought new hybrid and electric vehicles to market. Honda’s CR-Z,
Toyota’s Auris and Porsche’s Cayenne S Hybrid – which reached 0-62mph in 6.5 seconds and was
capable of 34.4mpg.</li>
	
	
		<h3>2012</h3> 
		
		<li>In 2012 Peugeot launched the world’s first mass production diesel-electric hybrid – the 3008 Hybrid.
The car impressed, bringing important benefits in both tax and many company car schemes</li>
	
	
		<h3>2013</h3>
		<li>The start of 2013 brought with it more good news for Toyota, as global sales of the Toyota Prius pass
the three million-unit milestone, making it the world’s best-selling hybrid electric vehicle. Mercedes
S500 plug-in hybrid, promising 94.2mpg and CO2 emissions of 69g/km. Powered by a 329bhp 3.0-
litre turbocharged V6 and mated to an 80kW electric motor, the car is limited to 155mph.</li> 
	
	
		<h3>2018</h3>		
		<li>Toyota unveiled the first-ever Corolla Hybrid at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show. The 2020 Toyota
Corolla Hybrid is equipped with a 1.8-liter hybrid engine paired with an Electronically controlled
Continuously Variable Transmission (ECVT). This car has the highest-ever EPA-estimated fuel
efficiency for a Corolla at 52 MPG combined. </li>
