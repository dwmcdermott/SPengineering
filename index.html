        <h1>Home Automation</h1>
        <h3>
          Home automation is the automatic control of electronic devices in your home. These devices are connected to the 
          Internet, which allows them to be controlled remotely. With home automation, devices can trigger one another so
           you don’t have to control them manually via an app or voice assistant. For example, you can put your lights on 
           schedules so that they turn off when you normally go to sleep, or you can have your thermostat turn the A/C up 
           about an hour before you return to work so you don’t have to return to a stuffy house. Home automation makes 
           life more convenient and can even save you money on heating, cooling and electricity bills. Home automation 
           can also lead to greater safety with Internet of Things devices like security cameras and systems.

        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of home automation has been around for a long time, especially in science-fiction that imagined 
          future homes being completely automated and robots helping us with household chores. The technology hasn't 
          been available to make these fantasies into reality - until now!
          Read on to take a look back at the history of home automation with us and see how a small-remote controlled 
          toy eventually lead us to the Internet of Things surrounding us.</p>
          <h3>The Remote Control</h3>
          <p>Way back in 1898, Nikola Tesla created the first remote control to operate a toy boat. Tesla worked out a way
           to use radio waves to send instructions to his boat from a handheld device.</p>
          <h3>Home Appliances</h3>
          <p>Before you can have smart appliances, you have to invent the appliances themselves! Between 1901 and 1920 there
           was a rapid development in domestic apparatus, kicked off by the invention of the engine-powered vacuum cleaner.
            After this, came the advent of refrigerators, washing machines, irons and toasters to revolutionise the lives 
            of domestic maids - but these were still too expensive for most households to afford.</p>
          <h3>The Kitchen Computer</h3>
         <p>After decades of progress in computing and developing electronics, the first ever smart device was born - the 
          ECHO IV. This machine could construct shopping lists, monitor your home's temperature and control appliances. 
          A few years later, the Kitchen Computer arrived, taking cooking one step further and offering recipes but was, 
          unfortunately, prohibitively expensive and never sold.</p>
          <h3>The Microcontroller</h3>
          <p>In 1971, the microprocessor was invented, meaning technology was finally taking steps to being readily affordable
            for everyone. The price of electronics fell rapidly, bringing the convenience of domestic appliances to the masses.</p>
          <h3>Smart Home</h3>
          <p>This phrase was coined in 1984 by the American Association of House Builders but it was still just a distant dream
            back then!</p>
          <h3>The Clapper</h3>
          <p>The clapper was an electrical switch invented in 1996 and operated through sound, most commonly a clap (although
            it can be accidentally triggered by coughing, dog barking or slamming a door). This was the first, real move into 
            smart home technology and was one of the 20th century's most iconic inventions.</p>
          <h3>Home Networking and the Millennium House</h3>
          <p>Home automation began to increase in popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s as internet technology developed
            fast and smart homes suddenly became a more affordable option. Domestic technology or 'domotics' was a highly 
            discussed topic as domestic appliances were being combined with computers. The Millennium House was a British 
            show-home opened in 1998 to demonstrate how running a home could be automated with computer-controlled heating, 
            security, lights, doors and gardens.</p>
          <h3>The Smart Homes of Today</h3>
          <p>As technology becomes more and more affordable, and with the majority of western populations having home internet 
            and a smart phone, smart technologies are slowly integrating into our homes. Today, the focus is on convenience, 
            security and energy efficiency through connectivity and interactivity.</p>
